# Computer Science 272 (COMP-272): Data Structures and Algorithms

COMP 272 covers analysis and design of fundamental data structures and engages
learners to use data structures as tools to algorithmically design efficient
computer programs that will cope with the complexity of actual applications.

The course focuses on basic and essential topics in data structures,
including array-based lists, linked lists, skiplists, hash tables,
recursion, binary trees, scapegoat trees, redâ€“black trees, heaps,
sorting algorithms, graphs, and binary trie.
