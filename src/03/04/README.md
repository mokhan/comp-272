Given sequence 3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3, 5, sort the sequence using the
following algorithms, and illustrate the details of the execution of the
algorithms:

a. merge-sort algorithm.
b. quick-sort algorithm.
  * Choose a partitioning strategy you like to pick a pivot element from the sequence.
  * Analyze how different portioning strategies may impact on the performance of the sorting algorithm.
