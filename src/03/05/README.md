Given the graph shown below, answer the following questions:

1. Illustrate the sequence of vertices of this graph visited using depth-first search traversal starting at vertex `g`.
1. Illustrate the sequence of vertices of this graph visited using breadth-first search traversal starting at vertex `b`.
1. Illustrate adjacency list representation and adjacency matrix representation, respectively, for this graph.
  * What are the advantages and disadvantages of those two representations?
1. Describe an algorithm to find in the graph a path illustrated below that goes through every edge exactly once in each direction.
