## Question 1
### Problem Statement

Design an algorithm for the following operations for a binary tree BT, and show the worst-case running times for each implementation:
* preorderNext(x): return the node visited after node x in a pre-order traversal of BT.
* postorderNext(x): return the node visited after node x in a post-order traversal of BT.
* inorderNext(x): return the node visited after node x in an in-order traversal of BT.

## Question 3
### Problem Statement

Illustrate what happens when the sequence 1, 5, 2, 4, 3 is added to an empty
ScapegoatTree, and show where the credits described in the proof of Lemma 8.3 go,
and how they are used during this sequence of additions.

## Question 4
### Problem Statement

Implement a commonly used hash table in a program that handles collision using linear probing.

Using (K mod 13) as the hash function, store the following elements in the table:

{1, 5, 21, 26, 39, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 111, 145, 146}.

## Question 5
### Problem Statement

Create a subclass of `BinaryTree` whose nodes have fields for storing preorder, post-order, and in-order numbers.
Write methods `preOrderNumber()`, `inOrderNumber()`, and `postOrderNumbers()` that assign these numbers correctly.
These methods should each run in `O(n)` time.
